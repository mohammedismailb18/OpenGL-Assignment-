## Question 7
Recreate the following figure by using only squares. The outermost square can be of any dimension, but should be entirely visible within the screen.
Note:- Make the background white and the edges in black
Hint: Identify a specific pattern that is getting repeated.

## Question 8
From each point on the strokes made by your mouse, draw a line segment to the world
coordinate (0,0). The color of the line segment is determined by the following rules:
* 1st quadrant - RED
* 2nd quadrant - GREEN
* 3rd quadrant - BLUE
* 4th quadrant - YELLOW
* x-axis - BLACK
* y-axis – BLACK

The brightness of the colour for line segment in each quadrant depends on the angular distance of the line segment from the starting angle of the quadrant. The ratio of angular coverage to the quadrant’s total angular distance is the color brightness. Ex:- If the line segment is in 3rd quadrant at an angle 4Π/ 3 from the positive x-axis, then the angle covered is 4Π/3 − Π and the brightness is determined by the ratio (4 * Π/3 - Π)/(Π/2). Hence the color is -> RGB (0,0,(4 * Π/3 - Π)/(Π/2)).
